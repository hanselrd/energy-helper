<h2>Reduction Electricity Use and Costs</h2>
<p>
  For energy reduction, capturing data is the means to tap into energy savings, which, over time, become an asset.
  In order to implement efficiency measures and generate revenue streams, it is important to determine areas of
  least efficiency. The reduction of expected energy use is a potential revenue source that may be manipulated to
  improve business performance and reduce waste and environmental impacts. There are two ways to generate an energy
  reduction asset: through an energy efficieny project or by participating in a demand response program. Energy
  efficiency results in long-term savings, while demand response programs produce immediate earnings and revenue streams.

          In our homes, we rely on electricity to power our lights, appliances, and electronics. Many of us also use
          electricity to provide our homes with hot water, heat, and air conditioning. As we use more electricity in
          our homes, our electric bills rise.

          You can take advantage of clean, renewable energy by buying "green power" or by making your own
          electricity with a small home renewable energy system. Learn the purchasing options available in your area,
          or learn how to plan your own system and choose the right technology for your location and electricity needs.
